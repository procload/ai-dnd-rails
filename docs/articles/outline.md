# Rails and LLMs: Building AI-Powered Applications

## Series Overview

The tech industry's fascination with complexity often leads us down convoluted paths. In this series, we'll explore how Rails' conventions and steady evolution create an ideal foundation for AI-powered applications. Through building a D&D character generator, we'll examine how "boring" technology choices often provide the most elegant solutions for modern challenges.

### Article 1: Rails & AI - Building Our Character Generator [✓ Published]

### Article 2: The Art of LLM Services in Rails [⚡ Next Up]

- Evolution from mock services to production
- Why service objects shine for LLM integration
- Building a flexible provider system
  ```ruby
  module LLM
    class Service
      def self.chat(messages:, system_prompt: nil)
        new(config).chat(
          messages: messages,
          system_prompt: system_prompt
        )
      end
    end
  end
  ```
- Provider abstraction patterns

  ```ruby
  module LLM
    module Providers
      class Base
        def chat(messages:, system_prompt: nil)
          raise NotImplementedError
        end
      end

      class Anthropic < Base
        # Anthropic-specific implementation
      end

      class OpenAI < Base
        # OpenAI-specific implementation
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- Error handling and retries
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Testing strategies
- Converting synchronous to asynchronous processing

Key Code Implementations:

- Full LLMService architecture
- Provider abstraction system
- Mock-to-production transition

## Connection Between Articles

Each article builds on the previous ones while remaining independently valuable. The D&D character generator serves as our consistent example, demonstrating how different Rails features and patterns work together in a real application.

Article 1 has established our foundation, introducing the core concepts and initial implementation. Article 2 will now expand on the LLMService we glimpsed at the end of Article 1, showing how to build a robust service layer for AI integration.

## Code Evolution

We'll see our codebase evolve from basic model definitions to sophisticated AI integration:

1. ✓ Basic character model and real-time updates (Article 1)
2. ⚡ LLM service integration (Article 2)
3. Real-time updates (Article 3)
4. Advanced features (Articles 4-6)
5. Production optimization (Article 7)

Each stage demonstrates how Rails' "boring" technology choices often provide the most elegant solutions for modern challenges.
