## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, idiomatic Ruby code with accurate examples.
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., user_signed_in?, calculate_total).
- Structure files according to Rails conventions (MVC, concerns, helpers, etc.).


## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for file names, method names, and variables.
- Use CamelCase for class and module names.
- Follow Rails naming conventions for models, controllers, and views.

## Syntax and Formatting
- Follow the Ruby Style Guide (https://rubystyle.guide/)
- Use Ruby's expressive syntax (e.g., unless, ||=, &.)
- Prefer single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed.


## Error Handling and Validation
- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages.
- Use ActiveModel validations in models.
- Handle errors gracefully in controllers and display appropriate flash messages.
