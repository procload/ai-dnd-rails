## Ruby and Rails Usage
- Always tell me the command line prompt to run in order to generate any migrations that are recommended. Never manually create a migration file.
- Use Ruby 3.x features when appropriate (e.g., pattern matching, endless methods).
- Leverage Rails' built-in helpers and methods.
- Use ActiveRecord effectively for database operations.
- Do not use Rails 7
- Use Rails 8 for this project

## Key Rails Conventions
- Follow RESTful routing conventions.
- Use concerns for shared behavior across models or controllers.
- Implement service objects for complex business logic.
- Use background jobs (e.g., Sidekiq) for time-consuming tasks.
