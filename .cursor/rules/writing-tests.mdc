# When working with or writing test files

1. Always attempt to run the tests after making changes to see if the tests pass or fail
2. Never remove functionality to get a test to pass
3. Ensure that we do not break or remove other parts of the application to get a test to pass
4. A working application is more important than passing tests
5. We don't need to boil the ocean, only write tests that are most important and relevant
